Scripts to make SolidWorks more productive


## 3DExperienceDisable
When opening SolidWorks, users are normally bombarded with a pop-up windows asking them to sign into 3D Experience. 3D Experience is a forum/knowledge base for Dassault Systems. Our users do not however, use this service and more often than not are irritated by the pop-up. You can forcibly block this by changing registry values inside SolidWorks. 

This script safely changes the required registry files after first, confirming the user has the admin permissions to run the script, confirming with the user that they are comfortable in changing said files, creating a backup of the changed registry keys before modification and robust error handling to ensure safety and reliability for everyone.
